<p>If you're a lover, you should know<br/>The lonely moments just get lonelier<br/>The longer you're in love<br/>Than if you were alone<br/>Memories turn into daydreams<br/>Become a taboo<br/>
<p>I don't want to be afraid<br/>The deeper that I go<br/>It takes my breath away<br/>Soft hearts electric souls<br/>Heart to heart and eyes to eyes<br/>Is this taboo?<p/>
<p>Baby we built this house<br/>On memories<br/>Take my picture now<br/>Shake it till you see it<br/>And when your fantasies<br/>Become your legacy<br/>Promise me a place<br/>In your house of memories<p/>
<p>I think of you from time to time<br/>More than I thought I would<br/>You were just too kind<br/>And I was too young to know<br/>That's all that really matters<br/>I was a fool<p/>
<p>Baby we built this house<br/>On memories<br/>Take my picture now<br/>Shake it till you see it<br/>And when your fantasies<br/>Become your legacy<br/>Promise me a place<br/>In your house of memories<p/>
<p>Those thoughts of past lovers<br/>They'll always haunt me<br/>I wish I could believe<br/>You'd never wrong me<br/>Then will you remember<br/>Me in the same way<br/>As I remember you<p/>
<p>Baby we built this house<br/>On memories<br/>Take my picture now<br/>Shake it till you see it<br/>And when your fantasies<br/>Become your legacy<br/>Promise me a place<p/>
<p/>Baby we built this house<br/>On memories<br/>Take my picture now<br/>Shake it till you see it<br/>And when your fantasies<br/>Become your legacy<br/>Promise me a place<br/>In your house of memories<p/>
