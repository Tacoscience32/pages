<p>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br/>Everywhere you go<br/>Take a look at the five and ten, it's glistening once again<br/>With candy canes and silver lanes that glow</p>
<p>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br/>Toys in every store<br/>But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be<br/>On your own front door</p>
<p>A pair of Hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots<br/>Is the wish of Barney and Ben<br/>Dolls that'll talk and will go for a walk<br/>Is the hope of Janice and Jen<br/>And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br/>Everywhere you go<br/>There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well<br/>It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow</p>
<p>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br/>Soon the bells will start<br/>And the thing that'll make 'em ring is the carol that you sing<br/>Right within your heart</p>
<p>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br/>Toys in every store<br/>But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be<br/>On your own front door</p>
<p>Sure, it's Christmas once more</p>
